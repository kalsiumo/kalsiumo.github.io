  <h1>Myth:</h1>
  <p><strong>"Socialism means everyone earns the same."</strong></p>

  <h2>Rebuttal:</h2>
  <p>Socialism does <em>not</em> mean that everyone earns the same wage.</p>

  <p>For example, the USSR. Under Stalin, most workers were paid directly by how much work they could produce<a href="https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/001896666" target="_blank"><sup>1</sup></a> 
    and other Soviet leaders such as Krushchev also had different systems they proposed and/or implemented. 
    Furthermore, in Karl Marx's <i>Critique of the Gotha</i>, he criticises equal pay for all workers in the socialist transitional stage:

  <blockquote style="border-left: 4px solid #b22222; padding-left: 10px; color: #444; margin: 15px 0;">
    "But one man is superior to another physically or mentally and so supplies
    more labour in the same time, or can work for a longer time; and
    labour, to serve as a measure, must be defined by its duration or intensity, otherwise it ceases to be a standard of measurement. This
    equal right is an unequal right for unequal labour"<a href="https://redstarpublishers.org/MarxGotha.pdf#:~:text=But%20one%20man%20is%20superior%20to%20another%20physically%20or%20mentally%20and%20so%20supplies%20more%20labour%20in%20the%20same%20time%2C%20or%20can%20work%20for%20a%20longer%20time%3B%20and%20labour%2C%20to%20serve%20as%20a%20measure%2C%20must%20be%20defined%20by%20its%20duration%20or%20intensity%2C%20otherwise%20it%20ceases%20to%20be%20a%20standard%20of%20measurement.%20This%20equal%20right%20is%20an%20unequal%20right%20for%20unequal%20labour" target="_blank"><sup>2</sup></a>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The end state of communism that <i>some</i> socialists believe in also does not necessarily entail equal salary. The philosophy is "From each according to his ability, to each according to his need."</p>
