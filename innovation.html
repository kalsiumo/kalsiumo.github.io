  <h1>"Socialism kills innovation"</h1>

  <h2>Rebuttal:</h2>
  <p>Socialism does <em>not</em> kill innovation. Here is a small list of innovations made by socialist nations, or government funding:</p>

  <p>
    The Internet (funded by Dep. Defense), GPS (funded by USA Military), Radar (funded by UK), Jet Engines (funded by UK/WR), Sattelites (USSR), Hubble Telescope (funded by USA),
    medical science (polio, penicillin, etc.), etc.
  </p>

  <p>A Capitalist nation will limit innovation by being driven by profit. This causes problems like planned obsolescence, which would not exist under socialism because there would be no
  need for it to. Or not actually owning things that you pay for. 
  </p>

  <p>This can be seen in the internal construction of companies. Companies work together internally, and as a result, do well. When companies try to run internally like a capitalist
  economy, it does not go well.</p>

  <h2>"But this will result in classes, which socialism claims to want to get rid of."</h2>

  <p>While this may result in different wealth groups, socialism defines class as between the bourgeoise and the proletariat.
  The bourgeoise are defined as those who own the means of production, and the proletariat. This is what class means in leftist theory.
  The bourgeois class would never be able to emerge under a socialist system, by direct nature of socialism, whether Marxist, Titoist, Utopian or other.
  The emergence of different groups of wealth would still keep everyone under one class, the proletariat, in a successful adoption of socialism.</p>
