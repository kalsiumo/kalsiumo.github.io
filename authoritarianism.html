  <h1>"Socialism is undemocratic and authoritarian.."</h1>

  <h2>Rebuttal:</h2>
  <p>Socialism does <em>not</em> equal authoritarianism.</p>

  <p>People will often point to currently or formerly socialist nations as 'proof' that socialism is authoritarian. 
    However, these people will massively overstate the democracy of capitalist nations, understate the democracy and freedom in socialist nations, 
    and misconstrue the relationship between socailism and authoritarianism.
  </p> 

  <h2>"Old socialist nations were undemocratic."</h2>

  <p>Many socialists will tell you that they do not agree with the old undemocratic nature of socailist nations. 
    While these countries did not democratically elect their leaders, the lack of democracy is exaggerated.</p>

  <h3>Inherent dictatorship</h3>

  <p>The dictatorial qualities of socialist revolutions are not inherent; rather, it is because they are all taking inspiration from the USSR.
    The USSR was the first properly successful socialist revolutions, and it was also incredibly economically advanced. 
    However, the USSR had flaws, especially in its governance system. The problem with previous socialist countries was that they 
    took heavy inspiration from the USSR due to its successes, whilst ignoring the failures of the USSR. However, this is far 
    less likely to happen in any modern socialist states to an excessive degree of non-democracy due to the widespread use of the Internet.
    With the Internet, socialists are more aware of what made the USSR good, and what made it bad, and therefore a new socialist nation may not be subject to the same flaw.</p>

  <h3>Participation in democracy</h3>

  <p>Many socialist citizens participated in democracy at a greater level than countries like the United States. 
    For example, in the USSR, people could pick between preselected candidates for congress by either approving or disapproving of a candidate.<a href="https://journals.openedition.org/monderusse/9370#:~:text=The%20conclusion%20of%20the%20campaign%20involved%20the%20widely%20ceremonial%20and%20festive%20process%20of%20voting%20for%20the%20candidate%20nominated%20in%20each%20voting%20district.%20At%20this%20stage%2C%20the%20voting%20that%20took%20place%20only%20allowed%20for%20the%20affirmation%20of%20the%20nominated%20candidate%20or%20a%20vote%20against%20them.%20There%20were%20no%20alternative%20candidates%20and%20unsurprisingly%20over%2099%20percent%20cast%20their%20votes%20for%20their%20nominated%20candidate.%20Beyond%20the%20performative%20and%20symbolic%20nature%20of%20casting%20a%20ballot%2C%20election%20day%20presented%20people%20with%20a%20time%20to%20celebrate%20and%20show%20off%20their%20%E2%80%9Cdemocratic%E2%80%9D%20rights.%20As%20part%20of%20election%20day%2C%20each%20voting%20district%20organized%20a%20celebration%20with%20childcare%2C%20food%2C%20and%20entertainment%20for%20the%20voters%20of%20the%20area." target="_blank" class="inline-link"><sup>1</sup></a>
    While this is inferior to proper democracy, the USA's presidential election is functionally somehwat similar, and leaves only an ultimatum between two parties, often which little want, and these parties 
    rarely represent the public interest.</p>
