  <h1>"Socialism is undemocratic and authoritarian.."</h1>

  <h2>Rebuttal:</h2>
  <p>Socialism does <em>not</em> equal authoritarianism.</p>

  <p>People will often point to currently or formerly socialist nations as 'proof' that socialism is authoritarian. 
    However, these people will massively overstate the democracy of capitalist nations, and understate the democracy of socialist nations. 
    The West has a clear idea of how democracy works: you elect your leader. When you follow this train of thought, it is unsuprising why you might 
    come to the conclusion that socialism is more authoritarian than capitalism.
  </p>

  <p>For example, take Yugoslavia. There was a ruling party, and an unelected leader (Josef Bros Tito). While this is a valid criticism, this does not mean that the Yugoslav Nation 
    was entirely undemocratic. For example, Tito mandated a democratic workers' council for collectives,<a href="https://www.marxists.org/subject/yugoslavia/self-management/1950/06/x01.htm" target="_blank" class="inline-link"><sup>1</sup></a>
    and in the 60s and 70s, the delegated system of assemblies was in effect. This meant workers elected representatives for local, regional and national parliament.</p>

  <p>In contrast, the west appears to be democratic at first glance, but actually isn't. The USA is the starkest example of this. Whilst they may elect their president, this system is undemocratic because:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>There is a bipartisan system, in which both parties represent the bourgeois</li>
      <li>Capitalist lobbying</li>
      <li>Having a backwards presidential election system that doesn't make sense</li>
      <li>Voter suppression</li>
      <li>Unlimited corporate spending in politics</li>
      <li>Representative problems</li>
    </ul>
  <p>No matter what election, you are either voting for the elite, the performatively "progressive" elite, or an elite.</p>

  <p>In the United States, it may be fair to say that there is incredibly little democracy, whereas in socialist states, there has always been some form of proletariat democracy, 
    despite having the flaw of an unelected leader. Furthermore, socialist nations often do not interfere with the eternal affairs of other nations, whereas the United States funds 
    the overthrowing of foreign democracy on a regular basis.</p>

  <p>Anti-capitalism is based on economic freedom of the proletariat, and individual mistakes don't make socialism as a system worse than the dystopian authoritarianism of capitalism.</p>
